# Data persistence & encryption

Structured local data lives in an encrypted SQLite database managed by
[drift](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/) (`lib/services/database/`). The schema
covers the technician profile, the local parts inventory, work orders, the manual
entries backing the FTS index, and a record of which seed dataset has been applied
(schema version 3).

Encryption uses **SQLite3MultipleCiphers**, bundled through the `sqlite3`
package's build hook (`hooks: user_defines: sqlite3: source: sqlite3mc` in
`pubspec.yaml`) — the current replacement for the now-legacy
`sqlcipher_flutter_libs`/`sqflite_sqlcipher` path. Because the hook bundles the
encryption-capable library on every platform (including the host), the same
cipher PRAGMAs run under `flutter test` as on device.

- **Cipher:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 (the SQLite3MultipleCiphers default, an AEAD
  scheme). AES-based schemes are also available on this stack; ChaCha20 is used
  as shipped. KDF iterations are pinned explicitly rather than left to the
  library default.
- **Keying:** the key is applied with `PRAGMA key` inside the `NativeDatabase`
  `setup` callback before any statement runs; a passphrase (KDF-derived) or a
  raw hex key (`x'…'`) is supported.
- **At rest:** the file header and row contents are ciphertext — verified by
  unit tests that assert the raw bytes carry neither the `SQLite format 3`
  magic nor plaintext row data, and that reopening with a wrong key fails.
